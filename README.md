New Web Dev Trailing -Linux Project

Greetings,

I am Stephen Svoboda, a full-stack software developer,/programmer who recently started with Prism Inc and CACI Inc.  I was tasked with completing the activities in the CACI New Web Dev Training document.  

As described I have written a bash script and I have used Git to upload it to GitHub.

I have also created an HTML page utilizing artificial intelligence and geospatial tools.

Thank you.
