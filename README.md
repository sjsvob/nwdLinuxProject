Greetings,

I am Stephen Svoboda, a full-stack software developer,/programmer who recently started with Prism Inc and CACI Inc.  I was tasked with completing the activities in the CACI New Web Dev Training document.  As described I have written a bash script and I have used Git to upload it to GitHub.

Thank you.
